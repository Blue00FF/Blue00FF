# Fabrizio's GitHub Profile

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fabrizio

## About Me

I am a Theoretical Physics graduate who enjoys applying my problem-solving, math, and statistics knowledge to data analysis and engineering in my day-to-day job. Iâ€™m passionate about exploring new technologies and continuously learning to improve my skills.

## Current Focus

Iâ€™m currently working on various projects to expand my knowledge in:
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Deep diving into Transformers, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- **DevOps and Kubernetes**: Learning to build and manage containerized environments
- **Home Lab Projects**: Working with TrueNAS, Raspberry Pi, and other hardware
- **Natural Language Processing**: Exploring state-of-the-art models and their applications
